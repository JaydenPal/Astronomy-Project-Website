  <h2 id="introdcution">Project Introduction</h2>
  <p>The document below is the introduction Dr.Wood provided us for the project. This includes how he is going to grade
    each part. I will add the rubric for our individual responses if it is not yet there.</p>

  <h2 id="data">Planet Data</h2>
  <p>The sheet below is all of the data we were provided with for our planet. Introduction states our base camp is at 40
    degrees north latitude.</p>

    <h3 id="part-A">Part A</h3>
      <h4 class="question">Question One</h4>
        <p>This planet orbits at a faster pace due to it being closer to the sun, with a distance of 0.91AU and Earth’s being 1AU. This planet’s orbital period is 317.07 days or 0.87 yrs., compared to earth’s orbital period of 365 days and 1 year. Its days (or rotation period) are also shorter than Earth’s by 3.4 hrs. This planet’s Perihelion and Aphelion have shorter distances than Earth’s. The Perihelion is 0.86AU, compared to Earth’s 0.984AU. While the Aphelion is 0.96AU, compared to Earth’s 1.016AU. This means our planet has a greater orbital eccentricity. When viewed by an observer, the Sun will appear closer than is would when observed on Earth (angular size 59º)</p>
      <h4 class="question">Question Two</h4>
        <p>This planet rotates at a faster pace than Earth. It only takes 21.6 hrs to rotate, compared to Earth’s 24 hrs. The tropical region extends 8 degrees north and south of its equator since the planets tilt is 8 degrees. This also means, the polar regions would extend 8 degrees from the North and South poles. Also due to the tilt, the Northern Hemisphere woould be facing the sun at perihelion.</p>
      <div class="question">
          <h4>Question Three</h4>
          <p>The seasons would be weaker because the tilt of the axis is not as much as earth’s tilt of the axis. Seasons would still occur but the changes wouldn’t be as strong as earth.</p>
          <p>Our planet would not have equal lengths of seasons compared to earth because our planet has a greater orbital eccentricity than Earth's, meaning the difference between our Perihelion and Aphelion is greater than the difference of Earth's.</p>
          <p>Since this planet has a smaller tilt than Earth, the seasons would be weaker in comparison. The planet’s faster rotation period and shorter orbital period will cause the seasons to be shorter in length and go by quicker. Both North and South hemispheres will have similar weather conditions since the planet has a small tilt of 8 degrees.</p>
          <ul class="sun-latitude"><h5>*oberving from the basecamp at 40 degrees North*</h5></ul>
            <li>The sun would appear 58º above the south horizon on the summer solstice</li>
              <li>40º - 8º = 32º ====> 90º - 32º = 58º</li>
            <li>The sun would appear 42º above the south horizon on the winter solstice</li>
              <li>40º - (-8º) = 48º ====> 90º - 48º = 42º</li>
            <li>The sun would appear at 50º above the spot horizon on the equinoxes</li>
              <li>40º - 0º = 40º ====> 90º - 40º = 50º</li>
          <ul class="sun-latitude">In <em>general</em>, sun will rise above and below due west and due east in the same way the sun does on earth. The only difference would be the degree in which the sun shifts between above and below the equator.</ul>
            <li>Summer solstice: sun rises above due east and sets above due west</li>
            <li>Winter solstice: sun rises below due east and sets below due west</li>
            <li>Equinoxes: sun rises due east and sets due west</li>
