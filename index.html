  <h3 id="part-A">Part A</h3>
  <h4 class="question">Question One</h4>
  <p>This planet orbits at a faster pace due to it being closer to the sun, with a distance of 0.91AU and Earth’s being
    1AU. This planet’s orbital period is 317.07 days or 0.87 yrs., compared to earth’s orbital period of 365 days and 1
    year. Its days (or rotation period) are also shorter than Earth’s by 3.4 hrs. This planet’s Perihelion and Aphelion
    have shorter distances than Earth’s. The Perihelion is 0.86AU, compared to Earth’s 0.984AU. While the Aphelion is
    0.96AU, compared to Earth’s 1.016AU. This means our planet has a greater orbital eccentricity. When viewed by an
    observer, the Sun will appear closer than is would when observed on Earth (angular size 59º)</p>
  <h4 class="question">Question Two</h4>
  <p>This planet rotates at a faster pace than Earth. It only takes 21.6 hrs to rotate, compared to Earth’s 24 hrs. The
    tropical region extends 8 degrees north and south of its equator since the planets tilt is 8 degrees. This also
    means, the polar regions would extend 8 degrees from the North and South poles. Also due to the tilt, the Northern
    Hemisphere woould be facing the sun at perihelion.</p>
  <div class="question">
    <h4>Question Three</h4>
    <p>The seasons would be weaker because the tilt of the axis is not as much as earth’s tilt of the axis. Seasons
      would still occur but the changes wouldn’t be as strong as earth.</p>
    <p>Our planet would not have equal lengths of seasons compared to earth because our planet has a greater orbital
      eccentricity than Earth's, meaning the difference between our Perihelion and Aphelion is greater than the
      difference of Earth's.</p>
    <p>Since this planet has a smaller tilt than Earth, the seasons would be weaker in comparison. The planet’s faster
      rotation period and shorter orbital period will cause the seasons to be shorter in length and go by quicker. Both
      North and South hemispheres will have similar weather conditions since the planet has a small tilt of 8 degrees.
    </p>
    <ul class="sun-latitude">
      <h5>*oberving from the basecamp at 40 degrees North*</h5>
    </ul>
    <li>The sun would appear 58º above the south horizon on the summer solstice</li>
    <li>40º - 8º = 32º ====> 90º - 32º = 58º</li>
    <li>The sun would appear 42º above the south horizon on the winter solstice</li>
    <li>40º - (-8º) = 48º ====> 90º - 48º = 42º</li>
    <li>The sun would appear at 50º above the spot horizon on the equinoxes</li>
    <li>40º - 0º = 40º ====> 90º - 40º = 50º</li>
    <ul class="sun-latitude">In <em>general</em>, sun will rise above and below due west and due east in the same way
      the sun does on earth. The only difference would be the degree in which the sun shifts between above and below the
      equator.</ul>
    <li>Summer solstice: sun rises above due east and sets above due west</li>
    <li>Winter solstice: sun rises below due east and sets below due west</li>
    <li>Equinoxes: sun rises due east and sets due west</li>

  <h3 id="part-B">Part B</h3>
  <h4 class="question">Question One</h4>
  <br>
  <h5>How does the composition of your planet’s atmosphere compare to Earth’s atmosphere?</h5>
  <p>Our planet has an evolved atmosphere that has a very similar composition of gasses to Earth's atmosphere. Our
    planet does have a denser atmosphere than Earth's, as well as a larger scale hieght. Our planets atmosphere is a
    secondary atmosphere created through volcanic outgassing. This would cause large amounts of carbon dioxide to be
    present in the atmosphere, but our planet’s surface being composed largely of water, dissolves the carbon dioxide
    into its oceans. Between the two gasses left, nitrogen has the highest concentration in our atmosphere followed by
    oxygen.</p>
  <h4 class="question">Question Two</h4>
  <br>
  <h5>Do you expect stronger or weaker warm fronts and cold fronts during seasonal changes? || Would you expect to find
    hurricanes on your planet?</h5>
  <p>Our fronts would be stronger due to faster rotation periods (ties into Coriolis affect) as well as a higher average
    surface temperature than earth allowing for faster winds. We would expect to find hurricanes towards the ends of the
    tropical region and around that area. They wouldn’t be likely to form over the equator for the same reasons they
    don’t form over the equator very often on earth. We would expect them to be stronger due to our planets increased
    surface temperature which would allow for the warmer waters hurricanes need to form. We would expect them to last
    around the same time or longer as they could be stronger storms that have more energy to last longer from stronger
    winds and warmer waters than on earth.</p>
  <div class="question">
    <h4>Question Three</h4>
    <br>
    <h5>Consider the density/pressure of your planet’s atmosphere, its axis tilt, distance from the Sun, and surface
      composition to answer the following questions:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Is your planet likely to be warmer or cooler than Earth on average?</li>
      <li>Does your planet have a significant greenhouse effect?</li>
      <li>Is your planet likely to have an ozone layer?</li>
      <li>Is your planet likely to have large desert areas (and therefore dust storms)?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It will be warmer than earth as they have similar atmospheres but our planets is slightly denser. Our planet is
      also closer to its star while also having less water on its surface to absorb extra heat in the atmosphere.</p>
    <p>Relative to Earth’s, no. Our planet has a slightly weaker greenhouse effect than earth but not by too much. </p>
    <p>Yes because of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere(30%), and the presence of Co2 which can have its oxygen
      broken off to form ozone with those free oxygens. However, there is not much co2, so if our planet does have an
      ozone layer, it is likely very thin.</p>
    <p>No due to the presence of liquid water and weather patterns that will bring this water to the land, which is
      numerous islands, in the form of precipitation.</p>
    <h3 id="part-C">Part C</h3>
  <h4 class="question">Question One</h4>
  <br>
  <h5>Consider the surface composition of your planet to answer the following questions:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>(a)	Is your planet likely to be geologically active? How do you know?</li>
    <li>(b)	Is your planet likely to have plate tectonics? What evidence (or lack thereof) leads you to this conclusion?</li>
    <li>(c)	Is your planet volcanically active? What evidence on your surface and/or in your atmosphere might support your conclusions?</li>
    <li>(d)	Is your planet’s surface susceptible to small impacts, large impacts, or both? Are you likely to see evidence of airbursts?</li>
    <li>(e)	Is your planet susceptible to significant wind and/or water erosion? What evidence (or lack thereof) would support your conclusions?</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="question">
    <h4>Question Two</h4>
    <br>
    <h5>Your planet is about the same age as Earth. Would you expect it to be hotter or cooler than Earth internally? How do you know?</h5>
    <p>We would expect similar ammounts of heat from the inital formation and accretion of the planets since they are near the same age, Earth would have slightly more due to its larger mass. Our planet also has a similar rotation period to earths. Along with energy from radioactive decay, I would expect our planet to have a similar internal temperature to earth but still most likely a lower temperature than Earth.</p>
    <h4>Question Three</h4>
    <br>
    <h5>What is your planet’s interior structure?</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>(a)	Is your planet differentiated? What evidence can you use to answer this question?</li>
      <li>(b)	Based upon your planet’s density and moment of inertia, does your planet have a mantle and a core?</li>
      <li>(c)	Using your answers from questions (1) and (2), do you expect your planet to have a thick crust or a thin crust? Explain your rationale.</li>
      <li>(d)	Does your planet have a significant magnetic field? What does this tell you about your planet’s core?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Since our planet's materials are like Earth, with a Rocky mantle; metal core, it is differentiated. The denser materials sink closer to the center.</p>
    <p>The moment of inertia of a planet is a measure of how much force is required to increase the spin of the planet. It is dependent on how mass is distributed around the planet’s center of mass. Our planet does have a mantle and a core because the density is 4867, and it is evenly distributed around the center.</p>
    <p>* I need to ask you guys about the crust. Ive seen answers considering that it has to be thin since we have a higher surface temp but i thought that was simply becuase of our shorter distance to the sun. I understand heat from the core can escape to the surface but even here on earth that heat is negligble when discussing climate and surface temperature. I think the heat of our planet causes tectonic plates to move and just different materials in the crust but i dont get how it increases surface temperature. Our planet has a similar surface temp to earth, almost the same with our weaker greenhouse effect. our planet is so simliar to earth so i would assume it has a thin crust but like is it actually because of internal core temperature?*</p>
    <p>This planet shows signs of plate tectonics and has a hot core. The inner core is solid like Earth’s. However, the outer core is molten and creates currents that create a signifigant magnetic field. </p>
    <h3 id="part-D">Part D</h3>
    <h4 class="question">Question One</h4>
  <br>
  <h5>Based upon the sizes and distances of your moons from the planet, would you expect to see a total eclipse of the star by either or both moons from the surface of your planet?</h5>
  <p>We could possibly see a total eclipse of our star if our 1st and bigger moon were to pass in front of the sun. This is because it has a larger angular size (.62 on average) on our planets sky than the sun does (.59 on average). Our smaller moon would only be able to cause a partial eclipse when passing in front of the sun due to its much smaller angular size in the sky (.06)</p>
  <h4 class="question">Question Two</h4>
  <br>
  <h5>Would you expect either or both moons to exert stronger or weaker tidal forces on your planet than Earth’s moon does on Earth? How do you know?</h5>
  <p>As individual moons, we wouldn’t expect stronger tidal forces than the ones exerted on earth by its moon. This is because the first moon, bigger than Earths, is orbiting out planet at a greater distance than Earth’s moon. Our moon may have more mass than Earth’s, however, distance has a greater effect on the strength of gravity between two objects than mass does. Since the mass of our moon is not much greater than Earth’s but the distance its orbits our planet is father, we can assume it exert weaker tidal forces.</p>
  <p>Our second moon is not only farther away than the first moon, but far less massive. We can safely assume this moon also exerts weaker tidal forces than Earth’s moon. </p>
  <div class="question">
    <h4>Question Three</h4>
    <br>
    <h5>Determine whether your moons are regular/native or irregular/captured.</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>(a)	Are either or both of your moons likely to be regular/native moons to your planet? How do you know?/<li>
      <li>(b)	Are either of your moons more likely to be irregular/captured moons? How do you know?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Regular moons orbit close to the host planet, follow nearly circular paths, and move in the same plane as the planet’s equator. In contrast, irregular moons have highly inclined, eccentric, long, and sometimes retrograde period orbits around their planet. Their orbits are highly elliptical and inclined relative to the plane of their host planet’s equator.</p>
    <p>i.	Our first, larger moon, seems to be a native moon. Its orbital inclination is only .1 degrees and has a semi-similar density to the planet. This could mean they are made up of similar materials and would support it being a native moon. However, the most compelling evidence of it being a native moon is its low orbital eccentricity and inclination. </p>
    <p>i.	Our second moon is a captured moon. Its orbital eccentric is incredibly high, a sign of a captured moon, and also orbits our planet at a great distance. These two pieces of evidence, as well as its lower mass and density, draws the conclusion that this moon was captured. </p>
    <h3 id="part-E">Part E</h3>
    <h4 class="question">Question One</h4>
  <br>
  <h5>Suppose you weigh 150 lbs. on Earth. What would you weigh on the surface of your planet? Use the ratio of your planet’s gravitational acceleration to Earth’s gravitational acceleration for the computation.</h5>
  <p>~~137.8lbs.</p>
  <p>The gravitational acceleration of the Earth is 9.8 m/s^2. The gravitational acceleration of our planet is 9.0 m/s^2.  150lb/9.8 m/s^2 = x/9.0 m/s^2 -> x=137.76 lbs</p>
  <h4 class="question">Question Two</h4>
  <br>
  <h5>From your observations, do you think that your planet could support eventual human habitation? </h5>
  <ul>
    <li>(a)	Would you consider the atmosphere to be “breathable?”<li>
      <li>While our planet has enough oxygen to, even more than Earth’s atmosphere, it has too much carbon dioxide (2%) to be considered breathable for humans.</li>
    <li>(b)	Would you need to bring water?</li>
      <li>i.	Our planet’s surface is 54% water so no. We could bring fresh water in case that water isn’t drinkable or technology that would allow us to drink it safely.</li>
    <li>(c)	Would you need to bring protection from ultraviolet radiation?</li>
      <li>i.	No. Our planet would likely have a stronger ozone than earth’s due to the higher composition of oxygen in the atmosphere. This would sufficiently protect us from UV radiation. </li>
    <li>(d)	Would you need to bring protection from solar flares?</li>
      <li>i.	Our planet has a magnetic field (.41 Gauss) that would protect the planet from solar flares like earth(.25-.65 Guass) does for us. So, it would not be necessary to bring protection from solar flares. </li>
    <li>(e)	Is there any special equipment might future human colonists need to bring to support a long-term colony?</li>
      <li>i.	Technology that would allow us to breath the air on the planet so that we wouldn’t have to stay indoors with clean air.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="question">
    <h4>Question Three</h4>
    <br>
    <h5>(3)	Develop a simple clock/calendar for your planet.</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>(a)	What is the planet’s revolution period about the star?<li>
        <li>317.07 days</li>
      <li>(b)	What is the planet’s rotational period?</li>
        <li>The planets rotational period is ~21.60 hours.</li>
          <li>Planet rotation rate = 16.67°</li>
          <li>360° / 16.67° per hour = 21.5957</li>
      <li>(c)	What are the revolution periods of your moons? </li>
        <li>Our first, larger moon, has a revolution period of 19.9 days.</li>
        <li>Our second, smaller moon, has a revolution period of 34.13 days.</li>
      <li>(d)	How many visible objects are in your planet’s sky?</li>
        <li>It has three visible objects moon one, moon two, and the sun.</li>
      <li>(e)	Are seasons going to be approximately the same length or different?</li>
        <li>i.	Our planet would not have equal lengths of seasons compared to earth because our planet has a greater orbital eccentricity than Earth's, meaning the difference between our Perihelion and Aphelion is greater than the difference of Earth's. This would cause seasons the be shorter as the planet approaches and reaches it perihelion as it is traveling its fastest. The planet would then have longer seasons as it comes to its aphelion when it is traveling its slowest.</li>
      <li>(f)	“Hours,” “Days,” “Weeks,” “Months,” and “Years” are Earth-based time units. Be creative in defining time units for your planet’s calendar.</li>
        <li>Our year will be divided into 10 months varying 28 days. Our weeks will be 7 days long. 1 day will be 21.6 hours. There will be 2 weeks of time that are not accounted for in the months but are their own separate holiday time. The months and days of the week are renamed:</li>
